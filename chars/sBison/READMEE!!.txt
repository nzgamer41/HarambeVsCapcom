power up mode: z+c   -1000 power

can use lvl 3 with 2000 or 1000 power, it will only cost -1000 to do so


AI:
is aggressive and uses all its abilities to win.
wont hesitate to take advantage of your hesitation.

;------------------------------------------------

100% Shin mode(based of of Bison II from Street Fighter Ex2+) = see config.txt to activate it

Shin vega only uses 50% of his abilities unless you unlock the rest by setting var(58) to 1

once in that mode you get the following:
use of all lvl 3's regardless of what power you have
the higher attack strength
use of all versions of Psycho cannon
loss of the ability to parry
loss of the ability to counter
loss of the ability to dodge
loss of the ability to roll
allowed to use recovery warp


AI:
will warp out of comboes over 4 hits at random.
will not spam lvl3's but will not hesitate to use them.
