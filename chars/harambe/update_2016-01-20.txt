2016-01-20 update:
- fixed that mis-named Orion gorilla sprite mistaked for Ant-Man, for the Gorilla Gun hyper (thanks due to Doom)
- fixed this issue: "since the Gorilla Gun puts its Enemy in a custom-state StateDef 4552, and 4552 is in [3000,4999] so you saw that error........may be next time I should use a Enemy custom-state StateDef # more uncommon......."
  * now using number like 456852 so non-duplicate can be ensured more now....
- make a ground-to-air nomral launcher (crouching "z"), using some existing unused sprites (?)....
- some minor fixes and A.I. re-done

2015-12-31 update:
- added back the removed the pterodactyl aka dinosaur bird riding in in-game intro (now three/3 in total)
- added the new hyper move: Gorilla Gun (D, DF, F + PK) [gorilla transformations classified by volzzilla]
- changed the command of the Telekinetic Barrage hyper move to D, DB, B + PK
- updated the readme.txt with the new Gorilla Gun hyper move and the 2015-12-14-modified Pteradactyl Call hyper move (D, DF, F + KK) 
  and the Telekinetic Barrage hyper move with a different command
- removed the skull throw special move command from MUGEN A.I.
- added all new win quotes [thanks to volzzilla]
- some minor fixes and A.I. tweaks done

2015-12-14 update:
- used Franken-spriting way to add the missing turn sprites for both standing and crouching
- the crown and jewel during Grodd's in-game intros can now fade out instead of sudden disappearance
- removed the pterodactyl aka dinosaur bird riding in in-game intro
- turned the pterodactyl aka dinosaur bird riding in in-game intro into a new hyper move in which Grodd calls the big bird out
  and rides on it and commands it to spit fire (you can control the big bird and press buttons a/b/c to spit fire)
  * to make this new hyper balanced, enemey may stop Grodd when Grodd is trying to hop on the big bird, once after Grodd
    is riding the big bird, Grodd is invincible the whole new hyper move, until the move ends
- removed the D,DB,B punch stun-enemy ability; it now only happens during the move's initial auto-guard
- added a new secret hyper move in which Grodd is able to turn enemy into something really interesting....
  .....(pending volzzilla's help and verification....)
- some more fixes and A.I. tweaks doing and coming...........

Now, I need some input for a "Bicho" aka "pterodactyl aka dinosaur bird calling helper attack" hyper improvement!
The calling out sprites of both Gorilla Grodd of the pterodactyl aka dinosaur bird are there and limited.
How shall I make it less cheap please? Question
Well, I have one (1) idea:
- how about making it a close-body throw hyper?  like, when Gorilla Grodd performs this "Bicho" hyper he has to get close to P2 then tries to grab P2 and lift P2 up with his arms, then the pterodactyl aka dinosaur bird comes in to crush P2 a few times?
- or........some other style and way.......please give me some input thank you in advance......

I think the lack of more sprites problem (i.e. no turning sprites and no intro transition sprites found by Red Hood) and the palette issue can be dealt with after this update as those sprites & palette things are something I don't know how to do by myself............
