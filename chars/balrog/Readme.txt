=========================================

Classic Balrog (M.Bison):
-------------------
- Hold start, and press any button at
  character select screen.
- Alternatively, rename the folder 'balrog'
  to 'cbalrog', and add the character in your
  mugen's select.def file.
- You can also add a separate Classic Balrog
  (M.Bison) by putting 'balrog/cbalrog.def' into
  your mugen's select.def file.

-ism Select:
------------
You can select up to 3 -isms. X-ism, A-ism, & V-ism.
Pick which -ism you want by pressing left or right during
your characters intro state before the match begins.
Once you select an -ism, you stick with the -ism until
you die, or until the game ends.
NOTE:	X-ism, A-ism, or V-ism is automatically given to you,
	depending which color you are currently using. You may
	switch to a different -ism before the match begins.

Shadaloo-ism:
-------------
To get the secret Shadaloo-ism before the match, hold start
on the VS. match up screen. Continue to hold down start during
your characters intro sequence, and press left or right when
selecting an -ism to get the desired S-ism.

Special Thanks
--------------
Capcom - For the inspiration to make this character
	 with the release of Street Fighter Alpha Anthology
	 (Street Fighter Zero: Fighters Generation).

ArtMoney Team - for providing ArtMoney. Without this
		program, it would be harder to get correct
		sprite axis and damage values from SFA3.
