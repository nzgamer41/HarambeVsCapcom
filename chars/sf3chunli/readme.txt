Finally, I relesed sf3 chunli.
I am sorry to detain for a long time.
It is very hard and tired works. maybe, I cannot make other sf3 chars no longer.
and zweifuss's ripped sprites are mostly PERFECT!, but it has little problem in pallect. so I fixed it.

Lastly, Have a nice game and enjoy playing her.
