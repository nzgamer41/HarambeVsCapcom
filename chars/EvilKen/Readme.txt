CVS2's custom combo mode... nuff said :p


--------------------------->
Tips and Tricks:

Taunt! Ken's defense increases after his taunt so slip one in every round to keep the upper hand.

Mash whenever possible! Mash his Shoryureppa, his shinryuken, his shippu jinrai kyaku, mega end, and his kick throw for more damage and more hits!

Ken's hadouken is mainly used to get closer to the opponent. Try throwing a slow hadouken then ashura warping forward to get behind the opponent.

Super cancel! You never know when your next chance to combo the opponent into a super combo will be, so when you do hit succesfully, try to burn all your levels.

Stay out of corners! Corners are any player's worse enemy. Use Ken's Hadouken/Ashura warp crossup to get you out.

Don't stay defensive! Use Ken's alpha counter's turn the tables! Back to down motion and attack will use up one level of your super bar. Counter with punch does an invulnerable dragon punch, counter with kick does a quick thrust kick.

Keep getting hit out of a super move? Throw a hadouken out right before you do the super move. The hadouken will keep going even throughout the super pause so you can catch the opponent off guard!

Don't leave your opponent alone when downed, dash in and OTG them!

Recover! Do not let yourself be juggled mercilessly by your foes, make use of the air/ground recovers whenever possible.
