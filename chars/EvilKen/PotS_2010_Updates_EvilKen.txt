GAMEPLAY:
- Lowered life and defense values
- Revised damage output

- Can charge power beyond three bars, just in case maximum power is changed or Simul mode is used
- Increased liedown.time
- Can throw with A+C and X+Z as well
- Power Charge can now be initiated by holding B+Y, not just pressing them
- Medium and strong Hadoukens can no longer eat other projectiles
- Fireballs are no longer drawn behind the player after hitting
- There are no longer normal attacks that deal guard damage
- Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku has a bit more startup and, as such, isn't unblockable at point blank
- Can't guard during dashes
- Shakunetsu Hadou Ken can no longer be made safe on block by mashing
- Aerial fireballs can be blocked low
- Revised fall recovery states
- Alpha Counters cost 2000 power and suffer from damage scaling
- Can cancel dash recovery with a second dash
- Senpuu Kyaku is no longer an overhead
- Attacking from a forward dash is now less insane, more like Darkstalkers dashes
- Weak Ryuujin Kyaku is now the one able to cancel to more aerial attacks, while strong one is the most damaging. This way all versions have a purpose
- Normal air throws have slightly different ranges from each other
- Can Rage Burst (custom combo) with only one power level
- Can't combo into Shun Goku Satsu
- Added Negative Edge
- Alternate Shun Goku Satsu finisher only happens on KO, but always does so
- Skuhachi's flames disappear if Ken is hurt or uses Tameiki Wari
- Normal attacks that allowed aerial fall recovery now just make P2 automatically land on his feet, less button mashing for him
- In the event of locking down a character in an infinite between his air chains and aerial Tatsumaki, those attacks will start knocking down after a certain time
- Kyouja Renbu now keeps going even if blocked, to make it more different from the other Lv2
- The punch in the Kyouja Renbu combo does a lot of hit stun now, meaning it is the best point to cancel the move with a roll
- Rolls are considered grounded and vulnerable to anything but throws
- The penultimate hit of MSSM Skuhachi is no longer randomly unblockable
- Normal throws can now be "teched"
- Attacks are flagged as idle during recovery
- Fixed high jumps getting off the ground before their animation start, and removed near high jump variation
- All specials and supers and specific normals force P2 to stand when they hit
- Teleports have slightly more recovery and don't build power
- Can no longer use Zenpou Tenshin with A+X, just to prevent the illusion that it's a KOF roll
- Fresh set of palettes. Many thanks to Hoshi and Anjel
- High jump cancels need down, up input
- Back + Y now uses the SFA3 headbutt
- Most specials now allow ground fall recovery
- Commands are more forgiving
- Taunts can raise defense up to three times, but raise it slower than before and the bonus is reset every round
- Cancelling a teleport into a super makes it have less invulnerability
- First hit of Shoryu Reppa can now reach downed opponents
