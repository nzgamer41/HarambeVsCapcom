# HarambeVsCapcom

Harambe Vs. Capcom is a parody fighting game running on the M.U.G.E.N engine from ElecByte by OtakuGang and NPCCollective. I have taken the original release and made a few changes so that it'll run better on modern machines.

## Changes:
- Updated M.U.G.E.N from 1.0 to 1.1beta1
- Changed Graphics renderer from DirectX to OpenGL
- Changed Resolution to 1280x720 (720p) from 1280x960
- Enabled scaling so the picture will stretch to 720p

## Why?
I think this is actually a pretty fun game, even past the novelty of having the dead meme of Harambe in it. But it had some issues running, especially in Fullscreen on a 1080p screen where I noticed weird lag that should be non-existant now.
