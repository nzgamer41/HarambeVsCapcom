===============================================================


Thank you for downloading this Motif for use with Mugen beta version
2001.04.14. This changes the appearance of your Mugen game's Title,
Select, Option, and Versus Screen. For more information about Mugen 
Motifs see the Readme.txt and Mugenfaq.txt found in your mugen 
directory. For more information about Mugen, visit 
http://www.elecbyte.com



About this release
------------------

First Official release of the 3rd Strike Motif. Previous versions
were very rough betas that were released as secret bonus downloads 
that were found in my other screenpacks.

Requirements
------------

Mugen 2001.04.14 (DOS).
Pentium 166mhz.
32mb RAM.



Installation
------------

1. In your Mugen's DATA directory, create a directory named 3S.
2. Extract the contents of this archive to your new 3S directory.
3. Move 3S.bat to your Mugen root directory. (the directory where 
   Mugen.exe resides).
4. Configure Select.def in the 3S directory (See next section).
5. Run 3S.bat to start up your next Mugen game using this motif.



Adding Chars to the Select Screen
---------------------------------

In the select.def file you will see some lines containing the following
text which will help you set the layout of the select screen.

randomselect;================= Insert char Here =====================

Replace 'randomselect' with the appropriate parameters to add a
character. See Select.def for information about parameters.

eg.
ibuki, random, order=9;============= Insert char Here ================

Following the layout guide ensures that your character icons will
follow the intended diagonal layout.

The same applies for Secret, and CPU only/Random Select only characters

eg.
Ayanami, stages\Unit0bay.def, order=7;==========Insert CPU-ONLY charact...
PocketVega, random, order=9;==========Insert Secret char here ======...


IMPORTANT
* Don't forget to add a ";" before the " ============== Insert char..."
                  eg. "...andom, order=9;============== Insert char..."                                
* If you have randomboxes in your select screen, then CPU-only 
  characters WILL be selectable BUT only via random select.
* Make sure that your "order" parameters are properly set for
  CPU only / Random Select only characters to function

See the file Select.def located in your DATA directory for more
information about inserting characters, and their parameters.
